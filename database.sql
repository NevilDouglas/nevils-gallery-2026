While Van Gogh has painted many portraits before, this is the most notable because it's one of the few that depicts him without a beard. Additionally, having sold for $71.5 million in 1998, it is one of the most expensive paintings ever sold.	\N	\N
9b48103a-6402-42d0-a0d1-370105aac378	/assets/img/initials/Three_Musicians.jpg	Three Musicians	Pablo Picasso	6	At first glance, it might look like a collage, but Pablo Picasso's famous painting, Three Musicians, is actually an oil painting. Completed in 1921, he painted two very similar paintings that are mutually referred to as Three Musicians and can be found in the New York MoMA and the Philadelphia Museum of Art.	\N	\N

While this might not be one individual painting, considering the collection is spread amongst the most renowned galleries of the world, the series deserves a spot on this list.	\N	\N
d8694e59-309f-4d56-a0d6-da82d921b0eb	/assets/img/initials/Starry_Night.jpg	Starry Night	Vincent van Gogh	2	Vincent van Gogh has painted countless well-known pieces; however, his painting Starry Night is widely considered to be his magnum opus.
